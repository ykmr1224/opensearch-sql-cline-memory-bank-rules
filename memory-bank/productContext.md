# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
OpenSearch is a powerful search and analytics engine, but many users are more familiar with SQL than OpenSearch's native query DSL. This plugin bridges that gap by providing:

1. **Familiar Interface**: SQL is the most widely known query language for data analysis
2. **Advanced Analytics**: PPL enables complex data processing pipelines beyond basic SQL
3. **Tool Integration**: Enables existing BI tools and applications to work with OpenSearch
4. **Developer Productivity**: Reduces learning curve for teams already familiar with SQL

## Problems Being Solved

### Primary Problems
- **Query Complexity**: OpenSearch Query DSL can be complex for simple analytical queries
- **Learning Curve**: New users need to learn OpenSearch-specific query syntax
- **Tool Integration**: Many existing tools expect SQL interfaces
- **Data Analysis Workflows**: Need for more sophisticated data processing capabilities

### Secondary Problems
- **Performance Optimization**: Manual query optimization is difficult for non-experts
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages for query debugging
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Standardized interface across different environments

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive SQL Interface**: Users can write standard SQL queries against OpenSearch indices
2. **Advanced PPL Commands**: Power users can leverage piped processing for complex analytics
3. **Seamless Integration**: Works transparently with existing OpenSearch clusters
4. **Performance Transparency**: Users get optimized queries without manual tuning

### Key User Workflows
1. **Data Exploration**: `SELECT * FROM logs WHERE timestamp > '2023-01-01'`
2. **Aggregation Analysis**: `SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM access_logs GROUP BY status`
3. **Complex Analytics**: PPL commands for statistical analysis and data transformation
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous queries for dashboards and alerting

### Expected Behavior
- **Fast Query Response**: Sub-second response for typical analytical queries
- **Accurate Results**: 100% correctness for supported SQL operations
- **Clear Error Messages**: Helpful feedback when queries fail or are unsupported
- **Resource Efficiency**: Minimal impact on OpenSearch cluster performance

## Success Metrics
- Query response time under 1 second for 95% of typical queries
- Support for 90%+ of common SQL analytical operations
- Zero data corruption or incorrect results
- Adoption by major BI tools and applications
- Positive developer experience feedback
