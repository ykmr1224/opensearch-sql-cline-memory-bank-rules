# OpenSearch SQL Plugin Project Brief

## Project Overview
The OpenSearch SQL plugin enables SQL and PPL (Piped Processing Language) query capabilities for OpenSearch, allowing users to query OpenSearch data using familiar SQL syntax and advanced PPL commands for data analysis and processing.

## Core Objectives
- Provide comprehensive SQL query support for OpenSearch indices
- Implement PPL (Piped Processing Language) for advanced data processing workflows
- Integrate with Apache Calcite for query optimization and planning
- Maintain high performance and scalability for large datasets
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing OpenSearch installations

## Key Components
- **SQL Parser & Executor**: Translates SQL queries to OpenSearch operations
- **PPL Parser & Executor**: Handles piped processing language commands
- **Calcite Integration**: Query optimization and planning using Apache Calcite
- **OpenSearch Storage Engine**: Direct integration with OpenSearch for data access
- **Function Library**: Built-in functions for data manipulation and analysis

## Target Users
- Data analysts using SQL for OpenSearch data exploration
- DevOps engineers monitoring and analyzing log data
- Application developers integrating SQL capabilities
- Business intelligence tools requiring SQL interface to OpenSearch

## Success Criteria
- Full SQL standard compliance where applicable to document stores
- High-performance query execution
- Comprehensive PPL command support
- Seamless integration with existing OpenSearch ecosystem
- Robust error handling and user-friendly error messages

## Technical Constraints
- Must maintain compatibility with OpenSearch core APIs
- Performance should not significantly impact OpenSearch cluster operations
- Memory usage must be optimized for large result sets
- Plugin architecture must follow OpenSearch plugin standards
