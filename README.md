# OpenSearch SQL Cline Memory Bank & Development Rules

This repository contains a comprehensive development environment setup for Cline (Claude Engineer) specifically designed for the OpenSearch SQL plugin project. It includes automated Memory Bank management, development standards, and workflow patterns that enable Cline to maintain context across sessions and work effectively on complex software projects.

## What This Provides

### ðŸ§  Memory Bank System
- **Persistent Context**: Cline automatically reads project context at the start of every session
- **Structured Documentation**: Organized knowledge base covering project goals, architecture, and current status
- **Feature Investigation**: Systematic approach to analyzing and designing new features
- **Progress Tracking**: Clear visibility into what's working, what's left to build, and current status

### ðŸ“‹ Development Standards
- **Java Coding Standards**: Comprehensive guidelines for Java development
- **OpenSearch Project Patterns**: Specific patterns for OpenSearch plugin development
- **Testing Requirements**: Built-in testing standards and coverage requirements
- **Workflow Integration**: Automated development workflow patterns

### ðŸ”§ Project-Specific Configuration
- **Multi-Module Architecture**: Tailored for OpenSearch SQL's complex module structure
- **ANTLR Integration**: Specialized support for grammar-based parser development
- **Calcite Integration**: Patterns for Apache Calcite query optimization
- **PPL/SQL Support**: Specific guidance for both SQL and PPL language implementation

## How It Works

### Automatic Context Loading
Every time Cline starts a new session, it automatically:
1. **Reads all Memory Bank files** to understand the current project state
2. **Loads relevant feature investigations** when working on specific features
3. **Summarizes key findings** and identifies next steps
4. **Applies development standards** and workflow patterns

### Memory Bank Management
The Memory Bank consists of 6 core files that build upon each other:
- **projectbrief.md**: Foundation document defining scope and requirements
- **productContext.md**: Why the project exists and how it should work
- **activeContext.md**: Current work focus and recent changes (session-specific)
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture decisions and design patterns
- **techContext.md**: Technologies, dependencies, and development setup
- **progress.md**: What works, what's left, and project evolution

### Feature Investigation System
- **Systematic Analysis**: Structured approach to investigating new features
- **Design Documentation**: Preserves investigation results and design decisions
- **Knowledge Retention**: Captures technical discoveries and lessons learned
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed strategies for feature development

## Installation & Usage

### For OpenSearch SQL Development
1. **Clone this repository** into your OpenSearch SQL project:
   ```bash
   cd your-opensearch-sql-project
   git clone https://github.com/ykmr1224/opensearch-sql-cline-memory-bank-rules.git .clinerules
   ```

2. **Cline will automatically detect** the `.clinerules` folder and start using the Memory Bank system

3. **Begin development** - Cline will read all context files at session start

### For Other Projects
This system is specifically tailored for OpenSearch SQL development, but the patterns can be adapted:

1. **Copy the structure** to your project's `.clinerules` folder
2. **Customize the Memory Bank files** for your project's context
3. **Modify the development standards** to match your technology stack
4. **Update the workflow patterns** for your development process
